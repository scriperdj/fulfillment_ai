# Communication Guidelines

## Tone Standards
All customer-facing communications must be:
- **Empathetic**: Acknowledge the inconvenience before offering solutions.
- **Professional**: Use clear, grammatically correct language. Avoid slang or overly casual tone.
- **Solution-oriented**: Always include a concrete next step or resolution.
- **Transparent**: Provide honest timelines. Never promise what cannot be delivered.
- **Concise**: Respect the customer's time. Keep messages under 200 words when possible.

### Info — No Customer Communication
Info-level deviations do not trigger customer communication. They are logged internally for trend monitoring.

## Channel Preferences
| Severity  | Primary Channel | Secondary Channel |
|-----------|----------------|-------------------|
| Critical  | Email + SMS    | Phone callback    |
| Warning   | Email          | In-app notification |
| Info      | None           | Internal dashboard |

## Language Guidelines
- Use the customer's preferred language when available.
- Default to English for all internal communications.
- Avoid technical jargon in customer-facing messages.
- Use active voice: "We are shipping your replacement" not "A replacement will be shipped."

## Response Time Standards
- Critical: First response within 15 minutes.
- Warning: First response within 2 hours.
- General inquiry: First response within 24 hours.

## Prohibited Phrases
- "That's not our fault" — instead: "We understand how frustrating this must be."
- "There's nothing we can do" — instead: "Here are the options available to us."
- "Per our policy" — instead: "To ensure the best outcome for you, here's what we can offer."

## Follow-Up Protocol
- All critical cases require a follow-up within 24 hours of resolution.
- Customer satisfaction survey sent 3 days after resolution.
- Unresolved cases get daily follow-ups until closed.
