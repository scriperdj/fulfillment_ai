# Shipping Policy

## Overview
All orders are processed and shipped from one of five regional warehouses (Blocks A–E). Shipping method is determined by product weight, destination, and customer tier.

## Shipping Methods
- **Ship (Sea Freight)**: 10–15 business days. Used for heavy items (>5 kg) or low-priority domestic shipments.
- **Flight (Air Freight)**: 3–5 business days. Used for high-priority items, perishables, and international orders.
- **Road (Ground)**: 5–8 business days. Default for domestic orders under 5 kg.

## Regional Timelines
| Region       | Road   | Ship   | Flight |
|-------------|--------|--------|--------|
| East Coast  | 5 days | 10 days | 3 days |
| West Coast  | 7 days | 12 days | 4 days |
| Midwest     | 5 days | 11 days | 3 days |
| South       | 6 days | 10 days | 3 days |

## Carrier Selection Rules
1. Orders over $200 default to Flight unless customer selects otherwise.
2. Product importance "High" always uses Flight.
3. Product importance "Low" defaults to Ship for cost efficiency.
4. If customer care calls > 4, escalate to Flight to reduce further complaints.

## Delay Handling Procedures
1. If shipment is delayed by more than 2 business days, trigger proactive customer notification.
2. For delays exceeding 5 business days, offer complimentary upgrade to expedited shipping on next order.
3. Critical delays (>7 days) require manager approval and may trigger automatic refund eligibility.
4. All delays must be logged in the system with carrier reference numbers.

## Tracking and Notifications

## Returns and Reshipping

## Cost Allocation
